# Urban Expansion along Roads

## Description

This project focuses on the classification of satellite imagery or aerial photographs to identify urban expansion along roads. The main objective is to develop a machine learning model capable of distinguishing between roads, buildings, and areas that do not contain roads or buildings (referred to as "None"). By accurately classifying different land cover types, the model can help monitor urban growth patterns, assess infrastructure development, and support urban planning initiatives.


## Preparing the Dataset

- Kaggle Datasets: Various datasets related to urban development, transportation, and remote sensing available on the Kaggle platform.
- OpenStreetMap: Crowdsourced geospatial data providing detailed information about road networks and urban features.


## Model Selection

#### U-Net Model for Image Segmentation
The U-Net model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed for semantic segmentation tasks, particularly in biomedical image analysis. It was introduced by Olaf Ronneberger, Philipp Fischer, and Thomas Brox in their 2015 paper titled "U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation."
